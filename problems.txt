183. Customers Who Never Order

  Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

  Return the result table in any order.

  The query result format is in the following example.

  SQL Schema >

  Table: Customers

  +-------------+---------+
  | Column Name | Type    |
  +-------------+---------+
  | id          | int     |
  | name        | varchar |
  +-------------+---------+
  id is the primary key column for this table.
  Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.


  Table: Orders

  +-------------+------+
  | Column Name | Type |
  +-------------+------+
  | id          | int  |
  | customerId  | int  |
  +-------------+------+
  id is the primary key column for this table.
  customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
  Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.

  # LeetCode posted solution using a subquery
  # Runtime 998 ms
  #   SELECT name AS Customers FROM customers
  #   WHERE customers.id NOT IN (
  #       SELECT customerId FROM orders
  #   );


  # My solution using a join
  # Runtime 447 ms
  SELECT name AS Customers FROM customers
  LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.customerId=customers.id
  WHERE orders.customerId IS NULL;

  # My solution has a faster runtime because joins are
  # more optimized than subqueries (at least in MYSQL.)
