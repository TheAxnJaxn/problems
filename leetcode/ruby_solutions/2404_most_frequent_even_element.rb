# 2404. Most Frequent Even Element
#
# Given an integer array nums, return the most frequent even element.
#
# If there is a tie, return the smallest one. If there is no such element, return -1.
#
# Examples:
#   Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,4,4,1]           Output:  2
#   Input: nums = [4,4,4,9,2,4]             Output:  4
#   Input: nums = [29,47,21,41,13,37,25,7]  Output: -1

    # keys of all the even numbers and
    # values of how frequently it appears.

    # the even number is equally as frequent and smaller than the tracked even number,
    # then set the most frequent even number to this number.
